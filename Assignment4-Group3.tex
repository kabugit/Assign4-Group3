\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The ever-changing mobile landscape is a challenging space to navigate. The percentage of mobile over desktop is only increasing. Android holds about 53.2\% of the smartphone market, while iOS is 43\%. To get more people to download your app, you need to make sure they can easily find your app. Mobile app analytics is a great way to understand the existing strategy to drive growth and retention of future user (Ramanathan (\protect\hyperlink{ref-dataset}{2017})).

For a new entity entering this dynamic market, it could be overwhelming to consider which space or genre to target. With help of our dataset, which captures a comprehensive set of information about the 7000 apps on the iOS app store, we have generated useful insights about this landscape. Our research questions will provide an analytical overview on usage, user ratings and various other parameters on apps and genre of apps.

Figure \ref{fig:numcount} shows that games are the genre with the highest number of rating, far higher than other genres.
Behind the games are social networking and photo \& video. Apps for entertainment receive the most ratings.

It can be seen from Table \ref{tab:ranknumcount} that the top three apps with the most rating counts are Clash of Clans, Temple Run and Candy Crush Saga, which were all the rage. Among them, the number of Clash of Clans and Temple Run rating counts exceeds one million.

After the update, most apps ratings have changed. Unexpectedly, all apps ratings have dropped. It can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:ratingdifference} and Table \ref{tab:rankratingdifference} that shopping apps have the fastest drop in ratings after last update. Finance, food \& drink and news are followed in the ranking, whose differences are around -0.7. And only the rating of the shopping apps fell below -0.8. Games has a lot of ratings, but after updating, the ratings haven't changed much.

Version code is a positive integer used as an internal version number. This number is used only to determine whether one version is more recent than another, with higher numbers indicating more recent versions. The value is a positive integer so that other apps can programmatically evaluate it, for example to check an upgrade or downgrade relationship (Developers (\protect\hyperlink{ref-version_code}{2019})).

{\centering \includegraphics{Assignment4-Group3_files/figure-latex/devplot-1}

\caption{Development-Rating correlation}\label{fig:devplot}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:devplot}

The plot above indicates that finance apps (on the far right) have had way more major developments than any other genre of apps, but not a relatively high rating.
Most of the app genres lie in the range of 1-12 developments, while also hovering around the 4 star rating, which is quite decent.
But finance and sports, with their huge number of major developments, lie below 4 rating, with sport at 3.6 and finance at 3.8 respectively.

Although, we know from table \ref{tab:finance-tab} and \ref{tab:sports-tab} that not all apps in these genres have had that many developments, with only a few spiking the average.

Health And Fitness, Games have the highest average rating among all genres, even though average major developments are only 3 and 4 respectively.

For Finance and Sports, though, if we remove the outliers spiking the average, what would the above plot shape up to be?

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{Assignment4-Group3_files/figure-latex/devplot-filt-1} 

}

\caption{Development-Rating correlation (updated)}\label{fig:devplot-filt}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:devplot-filt}

By removing only 2 outlier apps (Stock Martket Pro, Stock Markter HD) from Finance and one (NBA) from Sport, the graph becomes much more appropriately scaled. Finance average developments drop from 100 to 4, whereas Sports drops from 34 to 4.
So, in figure \ref{fig:devplot-filt} we see that Entertainment becomes the most developed genre at average 7 major developments, and even in this case, with an average rating of 3.8, the genre is not nearly one of the best rated. Clearly, app developments isn't corresponding to actually high ratings.

\end{figure}

According to the Figure \ref{fig:dataplot1}, there is no strong relationship between app categories and user ratings in different price. Each type of App has similar user ratings at different prices. However, we can find that the price of shopping and financial apps is lower than that of other apps, which may be because they hope to gain more users through low threshold, and medical apps are the most expensive, which may be because they provide valuable information about users' health.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

We have looked into various aspects of the mobile app landscape. We can safely draw the following conclusions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Ratings - Productivity has the highest average rating as compared to any other genre at just over 4, making it the only genre with an above 4 average rating. It is followed by Social Networking (3.9) and Photo \& Video (3.8). Catalogs are rated the lowest (2.1).
\item
  Usage (rating count) - Games, Social Networking and Photo \& Video apps are the highest used app genres. Clash of Clans, Temple Run and Candy Crush are the highest rated apps, making it clear why Games is the most used app genre.
\item
  Most languages - Productivity, Business and Photo \& Video are the apps with most supported languages on their platform, with Productivity supporting 11 languages. Finance apps are the lowest in this category with 2 supported languages only.
\item
