# Diyao Chen:

  summarise(average = mean(user_rating)) 

ggplot(dat2,
       aes(x = average,
           y = prime_genre)) +

1. Most number of rating counts for which apps/genre? (i.e., number of people who rated)

```{r}
num_rating_count <- dat %>%
  group_by(prime_genre) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(rating_count_tot))

ggplot(num_rating_count,
       aes(x = log(count),
           y = prime_genre)) +
  geom_col()
```



2. Rise/drop in rating since last update?

```{r}
rating_difference <- dat %>%
  mutate(rating_difference = user_rating_ver - user_rating) %>%
  group_by(prime_genre) %>%
  summarise(difference = mean(rating_difference))

ggplot(rating_difference,
       aes(x = difference,
           y = prime_genre)) +
  geom_col()
```
