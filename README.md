This report focuses on the correlation of app ratings with various parameters such as usage, price, size and version developments. We have tried to understand which genre of apps have the most acceptance, cost of purchase and even cost of working (version upgrades).

Following is a guide to understand all the variables in the dataset:

1. "id" : App ID

2. "track_name": App Name

3. "size_bytes": Size (in Bytes)

4. "currency": Currency Type

5. "price": Price amount

6. "ratingcounttot": User Rating counts (for all version)

7. "ratingcountver": User Rating counts (for current version)

8. "user_rating" : Average User Rating value (for all version)

9. "userratingver": Average User Rating value (for current version)

10. "ver" : Latest version code

11. "cont_rating": Content Rating

12. "prime_genre": Primary Genre

13. "sup_devices.num": Number of supporting devices

14. "ipadSc_urls.num": Number of screenshots showed for display

15. "lang.num": Number of supported languages

16. "vpp_lic": Vpp Device Based Licensing Enabled

We have aimed to create this report and generate insights in a manner for a new entrant in this sector to understand the lay of the land before entering with an app or a software. User ratings are a great indicator towards understanding the success of an app or a genre, and correlating different parameters to it can alter a significant strategic decision when launching a new app. We hope that anyone new entering this sector will be helped after reading through our analysis.
